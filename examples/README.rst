PySurfer Example Gallery
========================

This page offers a set of example scripts intended to demonstrate the
functionality offered by PySurfer, from the most basic tasks to more complex
visualizations.

For each script that produces a figure, the image is automatically captured and
displayed along with the code that generated it.

Used PySurfer to present neuroimaging data in a way that isnâ€™t covered here?
Please `contribute <https://github.com/nipy/PySurfer>`_ it!
